5 hour HACKATHON - how to prevent sexual assaults - WALL OF SHAME-
This is a project that allows anyone who has been sexually harassed/raped to report through an anonymous platform by adding that person's name/picture to the system about the case. The system makes it possible to find pedophiles/rapists by searching for their name / searching for a picture of them and will export if they found the same person in a database.
